		<h1 class="scioverview">OVERVIEW<h1>
		<p class="scitext">The study of entertainment and media technology is associated with the development, production, and distribution of media material through a variety of platforms, such as 
		video games, social media, music, and television. This industry integrates elements of computer science, art, design, and business to create compelling and interactive media experiences.
		<br /><br />Students who major in Entertainment and Media Technology will learn about a variety of media-related topics, such as media production, animation, digital imaging, sound engineering, and post-production. Additionally, they will learn how to tell stories, create content, manage projects, and be entrepreneurs. Because students are frequently required to complete projects that mirror real-world industrial circumstances, this curriculum places a strong emphasis on experiential learning and the practical application of abilities.</p>
		<h1 class="scireq">REQUIREMENTS<h1>
		<p class="scirtext">Certain institutions can have extra requirements for the Entertainment and Media Technology course in addition to these baseline qualifications. For instance, some 
		institutions could ask applicants to submit a portfolio demonstrating their artistic endeavors or work on multimedia or entertainment-related projects. A minimum grade point average (GPA) 
		or a list of specified high school courses may also be required by some universities.<br /><br />Additionally, some schools could demand an audition or interview procedure to gauge the 
		applicant's enthusiasm and interest in the field. The precise admission requirements of the college or university where you wish to apply should be verified, as each school has its own 
		distinctive collection of standards.</p>
