		<h1 class="scioverview">OVERVIEW<h1>
		<p class="scitext">A cross-disciplinary field called data science uses statistical and computational techniques to derive conclusions and insights from data. 
		In order to extract useful information from huge and complicated datasets, it combines techniques from computer science, mathematics, statistics, and domain-specific sciences. 
		The complete process of data collection, processing, analysis, visualization, and interpretation is covered by data science.<br /><br />Fundamentally, data science is all about turning 
		unstructured data into knowledge that can guide assessment and advise corporate strategies. This entails analyzing data for patterns and trends using statistical and machine learning methods,
		and creating models that predict that generate precise assumptions.</p>
		<h1 class="scireq">REQUIREMENTS<h1>
		<p class="scirtext">There could be particular conditions, such a minimum grade point average (GPA) or a list of high school courses that must have been completed, like mathematics, statistics,
		and STEM fields. To be considered for admission, candidates could also be required to provide credentials and other academic records. As part of the application process, some universities may 
		additionally demand interviews or letters of recommendation.<br /><br />Depending on the institution or university, different qualifications may be needed to enroll in a Data Science program 
		in the Philippines. However, the majority of schools and universities demand that applicants possess a high school diploma or an alternative and have finished their high school curriculum. 
		It's possible that candidates for a Data Science degree will also need to pass an examination intended for the course.</p>
