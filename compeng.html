		<p class="scitext">Computer engineering is a study that combines concepts from mechanical engineering with computer science in order to create and maintain systems for computers,
		including their hardware and software components. Computer engineers strive to integrate computer technology into a variety of gadgets and systems, from lightweight electronics like
		smartphones and laptops to intricate machines like cars and industrial machinery.<br /><br />Computer engineering is a study that combines concepts from mechanical engineering with computer

		<h1 class="scireq">REQUIREMENTS<h1>
		<p class="scirtext">Computer Engineering are merged in the five-year Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering (BS CpE) curriculum. Students receive a foundation in engineering, 
		computer science, mathematics, and basic science through the program. A bachelor's degree in the field is required to work as a computer engineer. Additionally, students take courses in 
		arithmetic, physics, and computer science.<br /><br />Information and Communication Technology (ICT) strand is recommended for students who want to major in computer engineering. 
		The strand gives students a fundamental knowledge of computer programming, technical drafting, animation, web design, and illustration. Students who complete the degree will also be able 
		to evaluate, plan, develop, install, operate, and maintain computer hardware and software systems.</p>
