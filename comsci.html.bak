		<h1 class="scioverview">OVERVIEW<h1>
		<p class="scitext">The study of computers and computing technology is the focus of computer science, a large and diverse field. It includes both theoretical and practical aspects of computer 
		hardware and software design, development, and use. Algorithms, programming languages, databases, networks, operating systems, computer architecture, artificial intelligence, and other subjects
		fall under the purview of computer science.<br /><br />Students who pursue a degree in computer science are given a solid foundation in programming and problem-solving techniques. 
		Additionally, students will have a thorough understanding of important theories and concepts in computing and IT, including data structures, algorithms, software engineering, and cybersecurity.
		These abilities are essential for creating software solutions and satisfying the complex requirements of the sector.</p>
		<h1 class="scireq">REQUIREMENTS<h1>
		<p class="scirtext">Depending on the educational setting and degree of study, there may be differences in the specific prerequisites to enroll in a computer science course. 
		A high school diploma or a comparable qualification, together with a strong basis in mathematics and computer science education, may be one or more general requirements. In addition to an 
		acceptable grade point average, certain universities may additionally demand standardized test results.<br /><br />Some colleges may evaluate applicants based on extracurricular activities and 
		appropriate work experience in addition to academic criteria. Prior to submitting an application, it's crucial to investigate the precise demands of the college or university you're considering
		and make sure you complete them adequately.</p>
